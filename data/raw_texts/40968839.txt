This article presents an innovative design of a tachometric anemometer for measuring wind velocity and direction, which does not contain electronic components and systems or power supply systems in the measurement area. This device can be used in
extremely unfavourable environmental operating conditions, in locations exposed to direct
atmospheric discharges, in conditions requiring restrictive and intrinsic safety, in special
military applications, and in measurements in the presence of extreme electromagnetic
fields. An innovative optical–mechanical transducer is used in the anemometer. This transducer generates a light pulse signal, the frequency of which is a function of the flow velocity,
and the duty cycle is a function of the wind direction. This signal is transmitted via optical
fibre from the sensor assembly to the measuring station, located outside the measurement
area. The design of the device is simple, durable, and resistant to environmental conditions.
