Gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases are among the most common diseases in the world, resulting in more than 8 million deaths. The majority of these deaths occur
due to cancer or tumors. Early detection of these tumors can greatly lower the mortality
rate. In this work, an implantable multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna sensor
is constructed for GI tract devices to detect the tumor. The implantable MIMO antenna
sensor has two embedded antennas, each operating at 915 MHz. Both elements of the
system are placed 0.6 mm apart from each other (edge-to-edge). The volume consumed
by this design is measured to be 7 × 7 × 0.25 = 12.25 mm3. It occupies a very small
volume due to miniaturization achieved using meandered resonating structures and a
high-permittivity substrate. It maintains stable radiation performance (gain = −26.2 dBi at
resonance). The antenna units are decoupled by maintaining a proper gap between them
and adding a slot on the bottom side. An isolation level greater than 28.7 dB is achieved
