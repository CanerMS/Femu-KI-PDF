IMPORTANCE Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are common and account for more than 25%
of psychiatric disorders in youths, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms associated with
risk and resilience among children exposed to ACEs are poorly understood.
OBJECTIVES To examine associations between ACEs and transdiagnostic psychopathology during
the transition to adolescence and to test whether these associations are modified by whole-brain
functional connectivity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study used data from the longitudinal
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study’s baseline through 2-year follow-up
assessments. A total of 6813 children aged 9 to 11 years at baseline were recruited from 21 US
sites between June 1, 2016, and October 31, 2018. Data were analyzed from September 2023 to
