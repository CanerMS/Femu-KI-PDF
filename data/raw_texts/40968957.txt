This article introduces a microwave sensor tailored for skin hydration monitoring. The design enables wireless operation by separating the sensing component from the
reader, making it ideal for wearable devices like wristbands. The sensor consists of a
semi-lumped LC resonator coupled to an inductive coil reader, where the capacitive part
of the sensing tag is in contact with the skin. The variations in the skin hydration level
alter the dielectric properties of the skin, which, in turn, modify the resonances of the LC
