Spinal cord injury leads to neuronal necrosis. Owing to the limitations of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult
body, spinal cord injury is difficult to repair. Seeding NSCs onto
conductive materials can promote their differentiation under the
influence of electrical stimulation, which may help in treating a
spinal cord injury. However, owing to the need for external
wiring and power sources, these clinical treatments are difficult to
implement. In this study, biodegradable MXene materials are
proposed for in situ wireless magnetoelectric signal generation on
MXene films under a rotating magnetic field to stimulate the
neuronal differentiation of NSCs. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the electrical signals generated on the surface of
MXenes can promote the differentiation of NSCs into neurons
and enhance neuronal maturation, leading to the production of electrophysiological signals. Furthermore, implanting “living
materials” assembled with NSCs into a spinal cord injury model, driven by a magnetic field, can achieve rapid spinal cord
injury repair within 28 days. This magnetoelectric stimulation, coupled with transplanted stem cells/conductive biomaterial
complex systems, should be easily adaptable to spinal cord injury regeneration applications and offer immense potential for
clinical trials.
