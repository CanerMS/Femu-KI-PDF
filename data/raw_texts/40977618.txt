Purpose: MRI systems are traditionally engineered to produce close to idealized performance, enabling a simplified pulse sequence design philosophy. An
example of this is control of eddy currents produced by gradient fields; usually
these are compensated by pre-emphasizing demanded waveforms. This process
typically happens invisibly to the pulse sequence designer, allowing them to
assume achieved gradient waveforms will be as desired. Although convenient,
this requires system specifications exposed to the end user to be substantially
down-rated, as pre-emphasis adds an extra overhead to the waveforms. This
strategy is undesirable for lower performance or resource-limited hardware.
