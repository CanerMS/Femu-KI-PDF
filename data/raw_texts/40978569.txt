Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) pumped by femtosecond lasers have become a widely used source of
broadband terahertz radiation. However, the strength of the
emitted field is limited in part by the optical damage threshold at
the pump wavelength. Thermal management of STEs can be
improved by understanding electron temperature relaxation in the
spintronic metal layer. Here, we present a measurement of electron
temperature dynamics on a picosecond time scale using opticalpump terahertz-probe spectroscopy. We observe that the optical
pump induces a change in terahertz transmission through the STE.
By analyzing the resulting signal with a two-temperature model, we
extract the dynamic electron temperature of the STE. This
