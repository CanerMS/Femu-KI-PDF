Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a widespread condition that requires reliable and non-invasive diagnostic methods to minimize patient discomfort. This study presents a radiofrequency spectrophotometry sensor specifically designed to detect
esophageal liquid flow and ionicity in real time without disrupting the patient’s daily life.
The sensor operates by measuring dielectric properties and ionic conductivity through
the thoracic plexus, eliminating the need for invasive probes or prolonged monitoring.
A study conducted on 49 participants demonstrated the sensor’s ability to differentiate
between various liquid media and identify beta dispersion relaxation as a biomarker for
esophageal tissue damage, a key indicator of GERD progression. Additionally, alpha
dispersion conductivity effectively distinguished reflux episodes, proving the sensor’s high
sensitivity. Unlike traditional diagnostic techniques such as endoscopy or pH monitoring, this radiofrequency spectrophotometry sensor enables continuous, real-time reflux
