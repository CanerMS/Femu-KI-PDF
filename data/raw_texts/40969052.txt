This study examines how the effective dielectric characteristics of the human torso affect the carrier-link-margin (CLM) and data-link-margin (DLM) of a biocompatible
gelatin-encapsulated implantable medical device (IMD) that consists of a small implantable
antenna, battery, printed circuit board (PCB), camera, and sensor operating at 2.5 GHz.
The specific absorption rate (SAR) and the radio frequency (RF) link performances of
the IMD are tested for ±20% changes in reference to the mean values of the effective
relative permittivity, Eeff, and the effective conductivity, σeff, of the human body model.
An artificial neural network (ANN) with two inputs (Eeff, σeff) and five outputs (SAR_1 g,
SAR_10 g, fractional bandwidth, CLM, and DLM) is trained by 80% of the total scenarios
and tested by 20% of them in order to provide reliable dependent analyses. The highest
changes in 1 g SAR value, 10 g SAR value, fractional bandwidth, CLM, and DLM at a
4 m distance for 100 Kbps are 63%, 41.6%, 17.97%, 26.79%, and 5.89%, respectively, when
compared to the reference effective electrical properties of the homogeneous human body
model. This work is the first to accurately depend on the electrical analyses of the human
body for the link margins of an implantable antenna system. Furthermore, the work’s
