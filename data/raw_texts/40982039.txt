Superficial siderosis (SS) is an uncommon condition resulting from chronic bleeding into the subarachnoid space. The 
hemosiderin deposition on the brain surface and spinal cord causes the progression of neurological symptoms. Although 
some reports have described the occurrence of SS following iatrogenic dural injury during spinal surgery, the pathophysi­
ology of hemorrhage remains unclear. Here we describe in detail four cases of SS that resulted from pseudomeningocele 
formation at the surgical site due to iatrogenic dural injury during previous spinal surgery. MRI revealed pseudomeningo­
cele eroding the vertebral bodies in each case. Out of the four patients, two underwent surgery. A significant dural defect 
was detected in both patients, exposing the bone marrow in the vertebrae within the pseudomeningocele. Additionally, 
microscopic examination revealed bleeding from the bone marrow in the pseudomeningocele. We employed fat or muscle 
fascia to surgically repair the dural defect, and applied bone wax directly to the exposed bone marrow of vertebrae. These
