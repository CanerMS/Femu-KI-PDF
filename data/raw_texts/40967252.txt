The Casimir effect, arising from vacuum quantum fluctuations, plays a fundamental role in the
development of modern quantum electrodynamics. In parallel, the field of condensed matter has
flourished through the discovery of various materials exhibiting broken symmetries, often
connected to topology and characterized by magneto-electric coupling. To enhance the
comprehension of the role of parity symmetry and time-reversal symmetry in determining the
sign of the Casimir force, we calculate the Casimir forces between magneto-electric materials
and obtain a phase diagram governing the sign of symmetry-breaking-induced Casimir forces.
We also investigate how the force phase diagram varies with the separation distances between
