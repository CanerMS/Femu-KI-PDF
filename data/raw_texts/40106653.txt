We provided a detailed description of the relationship between decade-long cumulative blood pressure (BP) exposure and 
cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-measured global and regional cardiac structure and function.
The research included 3015 adults with a mean age of 69 years from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) 
who underwent CMR imaging in 2010–12. 
• Greater 10-year exposure to systolic BP (SBP) was linearly associated with increased left ventricular mass index, worse 
global and regional circumferential strain (ECC), and replacement fibrosis as assessed with late gadolinium enhancement.
