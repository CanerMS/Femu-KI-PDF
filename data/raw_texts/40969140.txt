The purpose of the study was to determine if sensory electrical stimulation (SES), 
below motor threshold, would reduce spinal excitability via reciprocal inhibition 
(RI) and determine if any changes were sex-­related. Eighteen healthy participants (11 males and 7 females) participated in a pre-­post comparison study. The 
Hoffmann (H-­) reflex was elicited to assess the spinal excitability of Flexor Carpi 
Radialis (FCR) and the influence of RI from Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus 
(ECRL) on FCR using a paired conditioning pulse paradigm. A 15-­min bout of 
SES (4 pulse bursts at 100 Hz) was applied to ECRL, and the H-­reflexes were
