This work presents a novel dual-polarized antenna array tailored for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, specifically designed to operate in the millimeter-wave (mmwave) spectrum within the frequency range of 30–60 GHz. Leveraging printed ridge gap
waveguide (PRGW) technology, the antenna ensures robust performance by eliminating
parasitic radiation from the feed network, thus significantly enhancing the reliability and efficiency required by IoT communication systems, particularly for smart cities, autonomous
vehicles, and high-speed sensor networks. The proposed antenna achieves superior radiation characteristics through a cross-shaped magneto-electric (ME) dipole backed by an
artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) cavity and electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures.
These features suppress surface waves, reduce edge diffraction, and minimize back-lobe
emissions, enabling stable, high-quality IoT connectivity. The antenna demonstrates a wide
impedance bandwidth of 24% centered at 30 GHz and exceptional isolation exceeding
