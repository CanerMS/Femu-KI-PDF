One of the most intricate structures found in bacterial cells are 
magnetosomes of magnetotactic bacteria. These membrane-bound 
organelles contain tens-of-nanometre-sized crystals of a magnetic 
iron mineral that are usually aligned in well-ordered chains and 
function as sensors for geomagnetic field navigation in their aquatic 
habitats. Magnetosomes emerged as a model to study bacterial cell 
biology, organelle biogenesis and biomineralization, but they are also 
of interest as ‘magnetofossils’ in geoscience and have potential for 
various biotechnological applications. Recent work has unveiled a vast 
structural and genetic complexity of magnetosome biosynthesis. In this 
Review, we summarize current knowledge of magnetosome formation 
and organization within the cell, with emphasis on two established 
magnetospirilla model species. We highlight the function, diversity and 
potential applications of magnetosomes and discuss open questions 
for future research.
