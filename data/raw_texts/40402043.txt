■As social beings, people need to assist others in making
intertemporal choices. The right temporoparietal junction
(rTPJ) plays a crucial role in influencing prosocial behavior.
Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether and how rTPJ modulates self–other intertemporal decision-making. In the current
study, we mainly employed temporal social balance (i.e., “Self
immediate - Self delay” and “Other immediate - Other delay”
conditions) and temporal social imbalance (i.e., “Self immediate Other delay” and “Self delay - Other immediate” conditions),
with the identity of “Other” being a stranger. Prosocial behavior
occurred when the option involving “other” was chosen. While
stimulating rTPJ via continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS),
we manipulated the magnitude effect to investigate prosocial
behavior in intertemporal decision-making. We found that in
a small but not large monetary amount, cTBS manipulations
increased participants’ preference for smaller-sooner rewards
in “Other immediate - Other delay” and “Self immediate Other delay” conditions but not in the two other conditions,
demonstrating that cTBS over rTPJ can effectively influence
the above other-related intertemporal choices by increasing
the choice preference for smaller-sooner options. Our work
may help people deeply understand the difference between
self–other related intertemporal choices from a prosocial
perspective. ■
