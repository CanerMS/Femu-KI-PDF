this longitudinal study aimed to investigate the joint effects of prenatal air pollution
(i.e., prenatal ozone exposure) and socioeconomic
environments (i.e., school and neighborhood) at
9–10 years on limbic system (i.e., amygdala and
hippocampus) development, psychotic-like experiences, and cognitive performance at 11–13 years.
We used the
data of 6,778 children
from the
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)
Study, a large-scale, multisite population sample
in the United States. First, we examined the interactive effects of air pollution and school as well as
neighborhood on the development of the limbic
system
(i.e.,
amygdala
and
hippocampus).
We
hypothesized
that
air
pollution
and
school/
neighborhood environment would jointly alter the
structures of the limbic system. Then, we performed
a moderated mediation model to examine whether
the
altered
hippocampus/amygdala
structures
would mediate the association between multiple
environment exposures and psychotic-like experiences as well as cognitive function. We hypothesized
that children who experienced higher prenatal ozone
exposure and adverse school/neighborhood environment
would
have
altered
amygdala/
hippocampus volumes, which in turn would show
more psychotic-like experiences and poorer cognitive
function.
