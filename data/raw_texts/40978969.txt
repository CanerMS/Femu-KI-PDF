Atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) are uncommon complications of long-term use of bisphosphonates (BPs), a
common medication used for osteoporosis and other conditions that reduce bone strength and density. BPs
are effective in reducing the risk of fractures. Prolonged use of the medication can inhibit bone remodeling
and increase the risk of insufficiency fractures, most especially in the subtrochanteric and diaphyseal regions
of the femur. This case follows an 81-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of multiple myeloma (MM)
in remission and long-term sodium clodronate use for skeletal protection, who was seen in the emergency
department following a fall and severe right hip pain, preceded by two months of prodromal thigh pain.
Initial imaging showed a comminuted fracture of the right femur with slight posterior displacement and an
undisplaced atypical femoral fracture. Biochemical laboratory investigations revealed normal serumadjusted calcium and phosphate with slightly low vitamin D levels. For a more precise diagnosis, the patient
had a pelvic CT and pelvic MRI, which confirmed radiological features typical of AFFs, such as transverse
fracture lines, cortical thickening, and minimal comminution, with no evidence of active myeloma
recurrence. The patient's BP was controlled, and the AFF was managed with intramedullary nailing
(IMN).This case emphasizes the importance of having a high index of suspicion in patients on long-term
treatment with BPs to easily make the diagnosis of AFFs in elderly patients with prolonged BP exposure.
Invariably, early recognition of AFFs will enhance timely intervention, which will prevent further
complications of AFFs. Long-term BP therapy is beneficial in the management of osteoporosis; however, it
increases the risk of developing AFFs. This case underscores the crucial need for patients to be aware of the
signs of AFF, the importance of educating clinicians on how to diagnose AFFs, and the need for a
