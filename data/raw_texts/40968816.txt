Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven wireless communication are driving the adoption of Sixth Generation (6G) technologies in crucial environments such as
hospitals. Visible Light Communication (VLC) leverages existing lighting infrastructure
to deliver high data rates while mitigating electromagnetic interference (EMI); however,
patient movement induces fluctuating signal strength and dynamic channel conditions. In
this paper, we present a novel integration of site-specific ray tracing and machine learning
(ML) for VLC-enabled Medical Body Sensor Networks (MBSNs) channel modeling in distinct hospital settings. First, we introduce a Q-learning-based adaptive modulation scheme
that meets target symbol error rates (SERs) in real time without prior environmental information. Second, we develop a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based estimator for path
loss and Root Mean Square (RMS) delay spread under dynamic hospital conditions. To our
knowledge, this is the first study combining ray-traced channel impulse response modeling
