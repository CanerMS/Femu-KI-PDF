Conﬁning light in an on-chip photonic cavity with strong light-matter interactions is pivotal for numerous applications
in optical and quantum sciences. Recently, topological valley photonics has introduced new schemes for light
conﬁnement with topological protection, enabling robust on-chip light manipulation. Here, we present a topological
edge state cavity that conﬁnes light within a topological bandgap while robustly guiding it to circulate around the
cavity via topological edge states. We demonstrate a giant enhancement in the intrinsic quality factor by three orders
of magnitude, while simultaneously increasing the free spectral range from 5.1 to 7.1 GHz through tailoring the
radiation leakage and group index of topological valley edge state. Our work provides a novel and robust on-chip
cavity platform for a wide range of applications, including high-capacity communications, nonlinear optics, atomic
clocks, and quantum photonics.
