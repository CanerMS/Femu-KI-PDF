continuous advancements are essential to enhance the detection and monitoring of chemical hazards agents, ensuring rapid and accurate identification to mitigate potential threats. Effective sensing 
technologies must meet key criteria, including high detection sensitivity, minimal signal loss, efficient power 
utilization, compact design, and fast response time.
This work presents a PCF-based sensor specifically designed for the precise detection of highly toxic nerve 
agents such as Sarin, Soman, and Tabun. The proposed sensor is designed, simulated, and extensively evaluated, 
demonstrating exceptional optical performance in the terahertz (THz) range. The performance assessment of 
photonic crystal fiber (PCF) sensors relies on key metrics that define their efficiency and reliability39. Relative 
sensitivity (RS) measures the sensor’s ability to detect small environmental variations, expressed as a shift in 
resonance wavelength per unit change40. Numerical aperture (NA) determines light-gathering efficiency, 
influencing coupling performance11. Confinement loss (LC) evaluates light leakage from the core, affecting 
signal strength and accuracy11. Effective material loss (EML) accounts for intrinsic absorption and scattering41. 
Birefringence (B) quantifies refractive index differences in orthogonal polarization modes, while effective area 
(Aeff) impacts light distribution, nonlinearity, and overall sensor functionality11.
