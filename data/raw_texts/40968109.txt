Heterogeneous parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) offers a pathway to generate pure hyperpolarized
molecular agents devoid of toxic catalysts. While conventional
hydrogenative PHIP relies on hydrogenation with parahydrogen
(p-H2) and breaking the equivalence of the p-H2-derived protons
in the hydrogenation product, spontaneous net polarization is
sometimes observed in symmetric systems. In this study, we
explore a previously unreported case of net PHIP polarization in
symmetric products of heterogeneous hydrogenation reactions in
both gas and liquid phases. In particular, the effect was observed for
ethylene and orthohydrogen (o-H2) produced in the heterogeneous hydrogenation reactions of acetylene and dimethyl
acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), respectively, over an immobilized
iridium-based catalyst complex. This polarized signal is amplified significantly under continuous-wave radiofrequency irradiation. By
