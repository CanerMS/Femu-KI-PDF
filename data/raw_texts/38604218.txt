This pilot study investigated the long-term impact of a surgery-only treatment (no exposure to 
other treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation) for pediatric cerebellar low-grade gliomas 
on executive function, anxiety, and fear of pain (FOP) beliefs. Twelve patients who underwent 
surgical glioma resection during childhood (surgery age was 4–16 years, study visit age was 
10–28 years), and 12 pain-free controls matched for age, sex, race, and handedness were tested. 
The spatial extent of resection was precisely mapped using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
Executive function, anxiety, and FOP were assessed using validated self-report age-appropriate 
questionnaires for children and adults. Structured clinical interviews at a post-surgery follow-up 
visit were completed (average: 89 months, range: 20–99). No significant differences in FOP 
(FOPQ-C t[14 =1.81, p=0.09; FOPQ-III t[4]=0.29, p=0.79), executive function scores (BRIEF 
t[20]=0.30, p=0.28), or anxiety scores (MASC t[16] = 0.19, p=0.85; MAQ t[4]=1.80, p=0.15) were 
found in pediatric or adult patients compared to pain-free controls. Clinical interviews mainly 
categorized pediatric patients as not anxious. One participant reported mild/subclinical anxiety, 
and one had moderate clinical anxiety. Neither psychologists nor patients endorsed impairments
