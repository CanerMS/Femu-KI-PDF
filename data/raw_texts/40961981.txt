Few-layer CrPS4 is a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material with excellent stability in
ambient environment, which attracted significant interest in recent research. Here, via
first-principles calculations, we show that 2D CrPS4 hosts a variety of intriguing anomalous
Hall transport phenomena, owing to its layer-dependent magnetism and symmetry character.
Monolayer CrPS4 can display a sizable linear anomalous Hall effect, while its nonlinear
anomalous Hall response is forbidden. In contrast, bilayer CrPS4 can produce pronounced
intrinsic nonlinear anomalous Hall response from Berry-connection polarizability, in the
absence of linear anomalous Hall effect. We clarify that the large peaks in these responses
originate from gapped Dirac points in the band structure. Furthermore, we show that bilayer
CrPS4 also hosts a layer Hall effect, where the charge Hall current in the two layers are equal in
magnitude but flow in opposite directions. This effect can be detected as an anomalous Hall
signal induced by an applied gate field. Finally, even-layer CrPS4 also exhibits pronounced
in-plane anomalous Hall effect, where the Hall signal is linearly proportional to the applied
