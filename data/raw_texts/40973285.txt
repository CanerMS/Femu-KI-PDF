and elaboration of the mechanisms by which electromagnetic technologies regulate retrogradation in rice 
and other starch sources. Thus, grounded in the mechanism of starch 
retrogradation and the influence of starch’s multiscale architecture on 
retrogradation behavior, this paper synthesizes the classifications, 
retrogradation inhibition mechanisms, and applications in starch-based 
food of these five technologies (PEF, IT, RF, IEF, and MW). The objective 
is 
to 
furnish 
additional
