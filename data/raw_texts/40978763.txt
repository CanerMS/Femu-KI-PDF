Aortic diseases, including aneurysmal and occlusive pathologies of the thoracic and abdominal aorta, represent a significant 
source of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This narrative review explores the role of modern and emerging imaging 
modalities in the management of aortic disease and highlights the pivotal roles of computed tomography angiography (CTA), 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).
CTA remains the cornerstone for evaluating aneurysms, dissections, and traumatic injuries, offering high spatial reso­
lution, rapid acquisition, and detailed anatomical assessment. MRI, particularly with advanced sequences such as 4D flow,
