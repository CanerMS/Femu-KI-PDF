Millimeter-wave antennas have become more important recently due to the diversity of applications in 5G and upcoming 6G technologies, of which automotive systems
constitute a significant part. Two crucial indices, detection range and angular resolution,
are used to distinguish the performance of the automotive antenna. Strong gains and
narrow beamwidths of highly directive radiation beams afford longer detection range and
finer spatial selectivity. Although conventionally used, patch antennas suffer from intrinsic
path losses that are much higher when compared to the waveguide antenna. Designed at
77 GHz, presented in this article is an 8-element slot array on the narrow side wall of a
rectangular waveguide, thus being readily extendable to planar arrays by adding others
alongside while maintaining the element spacing requirement for grating lobe avoidance.
Comprising tilted Z-shaped slots for higher gain while keeping constrained within the
narrow wall, adjacent ones separated by half the guided wavelength are inclined with
reversed tilt angles for cross-polar cancelation. An open-ended external waveguide is
placed over each slot for polarization purification. Equivalent circuit models of slotted
