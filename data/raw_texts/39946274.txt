Purpose: Cancer-related pain (CRP) is one of the most challenging disorders among cancer survivors. Non-invasive brain stimulation
(NIBS) is an emerging technique for alleviating pain. Although there is evidence suggesting that NIBS can alleviate CRP, higher level
evidence is still required to further substantiate its efficacy and safety. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of NIBS interventions
