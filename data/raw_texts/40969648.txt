plot and corresponding feature importance percentages reveal significant heterogeneity in the associations 
between various HSE features and population health. Among these, 
the top six most influential features— NMIB:23.52%, UR:12.18%, 
MPPR:11.71, RAPC:7.93%, PD:6.93%, and UGPR:6.92%—contribute 
substantially more than others, indicating their central role in 
reflecting health level.
In the SHAP summary plot, NMIB displays a counterintuitive 
distribution: higher NMIB is predominantly associated with negative 
SHAP values, whereas lower NMIB corresponds more frequently with 
positive SHAP values. This pattern is consistently observed across the 
other five models, as shown in Figure 6, providing further support for 
our finding. From the perspective of health demand, the number of 
hospital beds reflects the health status and healthcare needs of local 
populations. Regions with a high NMIB often experience greater 
disease burdens, higher prevalence of chronic illnesses, or more
