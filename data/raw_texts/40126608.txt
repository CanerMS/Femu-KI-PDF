There are complex problems related to diagnostic imaging of the pregnant patient Cross sectional imaging with computed 
tomography (CT) tends to be avoided to due to the risk radiation poses to the fetus and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
may be limited due to avoidance of gadolinium contrast.
While ultrasound (US) is the primary test for imaging in pregnancy, there is limited awareness of contrast-enhanced 
US (CEUS) as a safe and accurate option for providing similar vascular information to that which is usually provided with 
contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. Microbubble contrast agents do not cross the placental barrier and have been shown in 
animal studies to pose no harm to the fetus at doses far above the human dose.
