a synergistic platform combining nanozyme-mediated dual-modal signaling (colorimetric/photothermal) 
with dual-recognition (aptamer/CRISPR) promises to overcome sensi­
tivity, specificity, multi-target, and field applicability bottlenecks, 
advancing AMR monitoring towards intelligence and integration.
Efficient degradation of residual antibiotics like AZM is pivotal for 
halting AMR propagation [29]. Current AZM-targeted technologies face
