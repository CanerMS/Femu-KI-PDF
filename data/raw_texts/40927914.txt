Optical imaging offers high sensitivity and specificity for noninvasive cancer detection, but conventional
techniques suffer from limited probe accumulation, tissue
autofluorescence, and poor depth resolution. Afterglow luminescence overcomes autofluorescence by emitting persistent
light after excitation, yet its utility in vivo remains hindered by
weak tumor enrichment and two-dimensional readouts lacking
spatial context. Here, we report luminescent-magnetic nanoparticles (LM-NPs) coencapsulating luminescent trianthracene
(TA) molecules and iron oxide cores within the amphiphilic
polymer pluronic-F127. Under an external magnetic field, LMNPs rapidly accumulate in tumors, amplifying the fluorescenceand light-induced afterglow signals and enhancing the tumor-totissue ratio. To recover three-dimensional tumor features, we introduce afterglow luminescence tomography (ALT), a
reconstruction framework that fuses LM-NP afterglow data with MRI structural maps in a unified space. By modeling photon
