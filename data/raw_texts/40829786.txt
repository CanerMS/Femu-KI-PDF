Bioelectricity is likely as old as life itself. From the moment the first protocell was enclosed in a lipid bilayer, a membrane potential arose. Thus, one
can expect that bioelectrical activities influence single-cell and collective
cell behaviors in processes such as embryo development, tissue repair, and
even disease. Despite the ubiquity of bioelectrical phenomena, most research has focused on bioelectrical control of neural tissues, and as a result,
our knowledge of nonneural contexts remains comparatively less understood, scattered, and often misunderstood. Still, there are strong reasons
for supporting the idea that bioelectricity contributes to diverse morphogenetic contexts. Thus, in this review we provide an overview of the current
knowledge of how cells generate and perceive bioelectrical inputs, and discuss how cells translate these stimuli into responses that influence tissue
morphogenesis in physiology and pathology.
