This paper presents a novel design of a compact dual-band dual-mode wearable antenna. The antenna is fed through a single coaxial feed probe, which excites TM01
and TM11 modes at 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz, respectively. These modes exhibit distinct
radiation characteristics. The omnidirectional TM01 mode at 2.45 GHz is suitable for onbody communication, while the directional TM11 mode at 5.8 GHz is more appropriate
for off-body communication. The antenna prototype was fabricated and measured. The
measured performance is consistent with the simulations. Additionally, further simulations
and measurements were conducted to verify the interactions between the proposed antenna
