Scleral tissue is a connective tissue made up of dense, intertwined collagen fibers that plays
a vital part in preserving both the integrity of vision and the shape of the eyeball. Numerous
studies have been conducted on the impact of terahertz radiation on biological systems.
Terahertz radiation can affect cell morphology and function by mediating modifications in
protein conformation and gene expression, according to recent research. Though terahertz
waves found in the environment directly expose scleral tissue, little is known about how
terahertz radiation affects scleral fibroblasts biologically. In this work, we investigated
how 0.1 THz radiation affected the global expression levels of proteins and the viability of
human fetal scleral fibroblasts (HFSFs). A total of 79.44% of the differentially expressed
