the central role of inflammation in the pathophysio­ logical processes of the cardiovascular system is well-established. 
However, within the field of electromagnetic biology, research on 
radiation-induced myocardial inflammatory responses remains scarce, 
particularly concerning biological data derived from human models. 
Against this backdrop and considering the limitations of existing studies, 
this research proposes a core hypothesis: The non-thermal effects of 
microwave radiation may activate specific key inflammatory signaling 
pathways, driving the sequential release of particular inflammatory 
factors, thereby initiating subclinical inflammatory responses and 
functional damage in cardiomyocytes. To test this, the study establishes 
a rigorously temperature-controlled microwave radiation model that 
simulates real-world exposure conditions while eliminating thermal ef­
fects. Through comprehensive assessment of iPSC-CMs viability, ultra­
structure, calcium signaling, and electrophysiological function, coupled 
with the integration of Olink high-sensitivity proteomics to systemati­
cally analyze inflammatory factor expression profiles and trace up­
stream regulatory pathways, this research aims to delineate the 
temporal evolution of the inflammatory response. The ultimate goal is to 
elucidate novel mechanisms underlying microwave radiation-induced 
myocardial damage, thereby providing a new scientific foundation for 
the precise assessment of associated health risks and the development of 
targeted protective strategies based on the dynamic regulation of 
inflammation.
