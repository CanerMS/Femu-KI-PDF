Magnetophosphenes are flickering lights perceived when an extremely low frequency
magnetic field generates a sufficiently strong electric field in the head. Understanding
how phosphenes are produced is crucial, as they form the basis for international
safety standards and guidelines for both workers and the general population. However,
there is still ongoing debate about whether this phenomenon originates in the retina,
the cortex, or involves both. Investigating magnetophosphenes at various frequencies
during dark adaptation provides deeper physiological insights into this process. Fortyone participants were exposed to varying levels of magnetic stimulation using a
custom global transcranial alternative magnetic stimulation system that provided fullhead exposure. Participants were divided into four groups: one light-exposed group
and three dark-adapted groups, each assigned a different frequency (20, 50 and
60 Hz). Every 3 min during a 42-min dark adaptation period, participants reported
their threshold for magnetophosphene perception. Flux density thresholds were then
compared across groups using repeated measures ANOVAs. The data acquired showed
a significant (F(15, 270) = 3.637, P < 0.001) increase in the magnetophosphene
threshold throughout the 42-min darkness adaptation period. An inversed exponential
decay regression was used to model the time course of the magnetophosphene
threshold for each frequency. The rising magnetophosphene threshold during dark
adaptation is likely linked to retinal phototransduction mechanisms, suggesting that
magnetophosphene perception originates from rod cells in the retina. In addition to
their significance for establishing new international guidelines and safety standards
