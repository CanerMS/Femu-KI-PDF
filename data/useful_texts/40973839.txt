Human-induced mortality poses a significant threat to many species worldwide, with Asian elephants in India being notably impacted. In recent years, electrocution-related elephant deaths have increased, 
particularly in the Northern District Landscape of West 
Bengal. A major contributor is the proliferation of illegal and hazardous electric fencing near protected forest 
areas. In many cases, farmers install electrified fences—
often unauthorized—to prevent crop damage from 
elephant incursions. Unfortunately, these measures frequently result in fatal outcomes, escalating tensions and 
provoking retaliatory actions. This study assesses the 
spatio-temporal extent of elephant electrocution incidents across a forested region of approximately 12,000 
­km2. A total of 63 elephant deaths were documented 
using official records from the Forest and Wildlife 
Directorate. Each location was assessed for temporal 
factors such as year, month, and time of occurrence. 
Advanced geospatial techniques—including remote 
sensing and GIS—were utilized, with kernel density 
estimation applied to generate a detailed risk map. The
