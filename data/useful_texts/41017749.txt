Induction hobs generate strong alternating magnetic fields to heat pots by inducing eddy currents. These fields are the strongest close to
the bottom of the cookware, but stray fields at large distances can still be substantial. In general, these are higher than the reference
levels defined by international electromagnetic exposure safety guidelines (ICNIRP 1998; ICNIRP 2010; IEEE 2019). That the reference
levels are exceeded does not imply that the basic restrictions are also violated. In this study, we assess the exposures caused by the latest
