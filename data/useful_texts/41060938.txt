The increasing expansion of energy infrastructure and anthropogenic transforma­
tion of the environment have introduced electromagnetic fields (EMFs) into aquatic 
ecosystems. While studies on the impact of EMFs on aquatic organisms are growing, 
their effects on fish embryonic development remain poorly understood. This study 
investigated the influence of electromagnetic exposure dominated by the magnetic 
(B) component, measured at 11.15 (± 2.24) μT and 50 Hz, on the heart rate of vimba 
bream (Vimba vimba) embryos, a species of conservation significance in aquacul­
ture. The electric (E) component was not measured, and its potential contribution 
cannot be excluded. Fertilized V. vimba eggs were incubated under control conditions
