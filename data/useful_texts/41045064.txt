Compliance testing of wireless devices with absorbed power density (APD) limits requires body models that conservatively
reproduce the absorption characteristics of human skin. Previous studies indicate that impedance‐matching effects are
caused by the stratum corneum (SC) layer. The objective of this study is to develop a single macroscopic dielectric model
reproducing absorption of electromagnetic fields by the skin up to 110 GHz. The reflection coefficient of the skin of human
volunteers was measured at frequencies of 15 to 43 GHz with open waveguide probes, complementing previous data from
