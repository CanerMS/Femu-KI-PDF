Studies have demonstrated that being exposed to electromagnetic fields (EMFs), especially to Schumann
frequencies, may affect physiological functions. This study investigated the effects of very low frequencies
(Schumann - 7.83 Hz) and low intensity (1 μT) on short- and mid-term physical jump performance of male
teenagers aged 12 to 15 years in Colegio Andrés Escobar in Bogotá. A group of 20 participants was divided
into two groups: one exposed to the EMFs (irradiation group) and another serving as a control without
additional irradiation. Over the course of eight weeks, one-hour exposure sessions took place once per week,
