Peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) present significant clinical challenges, often leading to
severe motor, sensory, and autonomic dysfunction, with profound impacts on patient
quality of life and considerable healthcare costs. This review synthesizes current knowledge
on the therapeutic potential of Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMF) and Low-Intensity
Pulsed Ultrasound (LIPUS) as non-invasive modalities for promoting peripheral nerve
regeneration. We explore their cellular and molecular mechanisms of action, discuss
optimal treatment parameters, and present evidence from preclinical and clinical studies,
including their synergistic effects with other therapies and emerging applications beyond
neurological repair. Clinical studies have shown that PEMF therapy can significantly
reduce neuropathic pain and improve functions, whereas LIPUS demonstrates the ability
to enhance nerve conduction.
