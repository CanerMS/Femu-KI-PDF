Electric fields modulate the structure and mechanical properties of biological membranes, influencing diverse cellular processes. While the effects
of vertical electric fields (EVert) across the membranes have been extensively
studied, the influence of horizontal (in-plane) electric fields (EHorz) remains
poorly understood. Here, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
bright-field imaging of planar lipid bilayers (PLBs), fundamental components of
biological membranes, we investigate how EHorz and EVert affect lipid bilayer
properties. Simulations revealed that EHorz induces greater structural changes
than EVert, such as membrane area reduction and increases in lipid tail ordering,
even at high cholesterol concentrations. Consistently, bright-field imaging
shows that the DC horizontal membrane voltage (VHorz) causes membrane area
contraction, whereas the vertical voltage (VVert) has no effect under the tested
