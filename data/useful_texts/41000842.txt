Spanning frogs, fish, and humans, direct-current (DC) bioelectric cues play 
critical roles beyond neuro-muscular function, such as modulating morphogenesis, 
immune response, and healing through electrotaxis—electrically directed cell migration. 
Harnessing this potential requires new tools. However, standardized, accessible, and 
reproducible infrastructure capable of DC stimulation remains a challenge. We present 
SCHEPHERD: a universal, electrobioreactor integrating 8 stimulation channels and 
modular inserts to enable most electrotaxis assays in one device (cells, monolayers, 
and 3D spheroids), while enabling powerful, new capabilities. SCHEPHERD revealed 
through parameter sweeps that DC fields act like a ‘steering wheel and gas pedal’ for 
cell migration. We then used live confocal imaging to observe electrically reprogrammed 
F-actin dynamics. Finally, our multi-polar inserts generated complex spatial electrical 
patterns that reorganize engineered tissue dynamics. By significantly improving 
accessibility through modularity and an open-source, graphically programmed 
stimulator, we hope SCHEPHERD can help broaden the community studying these 
important DC bioelectric phenomena.
