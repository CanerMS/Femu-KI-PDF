Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and tenderness,
cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, and insomnia. Electroacupuncture (EA) has documented
efficacy against FM-associated pain, while cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) plays a critical
role in endogenous analgesia. Herein, we examined whether pain relief initiated by
EA was linked with differing cerebellar CB1 levels and signaling in an intermittent cold
stress (ICS) mouse model of FM. FM-like hyperalgesia and recovery were assessed by
measuring mechanical and thermal nociceptive thresholds. Compared to control mice,
ICS-induced FM-model mice exhibited a significantly reduced mechanical withdrawal
threshold (2.3 ± 0.1 g) and shorter thermal withdrawal latency (4.0 ± 0.5 s), indicative of
mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia. Both conditions were reversed by 2 Hz EA but not
sham EA. Hyperalgesia was associated with reduced CB1 receptor expression and the
enhanced activity of multiple nociceptive signaling pathways (PKA, PI3K, Akt, mTOR,
ERK, and NF-kB) in the mouse cerebellum. The 2 Hz EA treatment reliably reversed these
abnormalities, while the sham EA treatment did not. Intracerebroventricular injection of the
CB1 agonist anandamide (AEA) recapitulated the effects of EA on pain thresholds, while the
analgesic effects of EA were blocked by the CB1 antagonist AM251. Precise chemogenetic
stimulation at the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus reliably induced FM
pain. Chemogenetic inhibition at the PVN diminished FM through the CB1 pathway in
