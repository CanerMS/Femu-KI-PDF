Objectives: Electroconvulsive shock (ES) can ameliorate psychotic symptoms and certain adverse effects of antipsychotics by inducing seizure 
activity via electrical brain stimulation. Although the relationship between ES and glial cells has been the focus of attention, the precise mechanisms 
underlying its effects remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ES on astroglia in the drug-induced neurotoxicity rat model.
