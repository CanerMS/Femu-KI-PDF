Static magnetic field (SMF) is an emerging food-processing technology that has been
widely applied in areas such as processing and sterilization. However, its influence on
sprout production or health-related attributes has not yet been investigated. Therefore,
in this study, corn sprouts were used as the raw material to compare the differential
health effects of SMF treatment in a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced
colitis. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of SMF-treated corn sprouts were assessed
by analyzing changes in their active ingredients. Histological staining, qRT-PCR and 16s
