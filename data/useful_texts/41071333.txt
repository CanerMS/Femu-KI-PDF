Electrical signals play a critical role in neuronal functions and physiological processes. However, accurately characterizing subtle membrane potential changes at the cellular level remains
challenging. In this study, we investigated the membrane voltage
responses of undifferentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells exposed
to pulsed electric fields of 5, 10, and 20 V m−1 at 100 Hz using
conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM). CAFM allowed for
nanoscale spatial resolution and precise detection of membrane
