This study investigated the effects of magnetic field therapy and massage on upper
trapezius muscle tone, craniovertebral angle (CVA), and scapular index in young adults.
Thirty participants were randomly assigned to a magnetic field group or a massage group
(n = 15 each), receiving interventions twice a week for two weeks with a one-week follow-up.
Measurements were taken at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up using MyotonPRO,
lateral photographs, and anatomical distances. The magnetic group showed a greater
reduction in muscle tone at post-intervention and follow-up (p = 0.015, partial η2 = 0.28,
large effect) than the massage group. Elasticity decreased significantly in both groups, but
follow-up values were lower in the magnetic group (p < 0.05, partial η2 = 0.25, medium
effect). CVA improved in both groups, with a larger change in the magnetic group and
sustained gains at follow-up (p < 0.001, partial η2 up to 0.43, large effect). The scapular
index increased only in the magnetic group post-intervention (p = 0.013, partial η2 = 0.49,
large effect) but returned to baseline at follow-up. Magnetic field therapy appears more
effective than massage for improving muscle tone, posture, and scapular alignment in the
short term, and may be a valuable option for clinical postural correction.
