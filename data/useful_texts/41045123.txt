Objective: Incisional pain, which is the most commonly observed postoperative complication, is closely related to the 
release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Although electroacupuncture (EA) has been demonstrated to reduce 
incisional pain, its analgesic mechanisms remain unclear. We aimed to investigate whether EA alleviates incisional pain 
in rats by regulating the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and procalcitonin (PCT) in the astrocytes and neurons of the 
spinal cord dorsal horn.
