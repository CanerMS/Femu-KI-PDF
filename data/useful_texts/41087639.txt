Electrical injuries often result in severe consequences, posing significant challenges for post-injury treatment. However, there 
is currently a lack of large-scale and in-depth retrospective studies on the prognosis of electrical injuries. This study was 
conducted to analyze in depth the clinical prognosis associated with high-voltage and low-voltage electrical injuries. This 
retrospective study incorporated patients who had suffered from electrical injuries and were admitted to the Burn Department 
of the First Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University within the past two decades. Patients were categorized into a 
high-voltage group (n = 772) and a low-voltage group (n = 654) based on voltage levels. Propensity score matching (PSM)
