Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) are common and clinically important complications in patients supported by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), occurring in up to 50% of cases
within the first year after implantation. Despite the hemodynamic support provided by
LVADs, VAs are linked to increased morbidity and mortality, primarily through recurrent
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shocks and right ventricular failure. The underlying mechanisms of VAs in this population are multifactorial, involving structural
myocardial remodeling, device-related factors, and pre-existing arrhythmic substrates.
Catheter ablation has become a valuable treatment option when antiarrhythmic drug therapy and device reprogramming are inadequate, though procedural timing (pre-, intra-,
