— In this article, the design of a non-invasive wearable antenna-based fat intra-body communication (Fat-IBC) system is
presented for biomedical applications. The Fat-IBC system is used
for uninterrupted communication between various wearable, implanted, and semi-implanted devices, facilitating the exchange of
data and information within body area networks (BAN). Herein, to
eliminate the design complexity, a simple planar-loop antenna is
