Pathological synaptic plasticity, manifested as ischemic long-term potentiation, drives neuronal hyperexcitability following 
oxygen-glucose deprivation. While ischemic long-term potentiation (iLTP) is mediated by excessive GluN2B-containing 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) activity, the molecular mechanisms sustaining this aberrant plasticity remain 
poorly understood. FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), a stress-related modulator of plasticity, has emerged as a poten­
tial regulator; however, its role in iLTP has not yet been explored. Cathodal direct current stimulation (cDCS), known to 
suppress pathological hyperexcitability, may offer therapeutic modulation of this process. In this study, we demonstrated 
that oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) induces iLTP alongside FKBP51 upregulation and GluN2B surface accumulation. 
Genetic deletion of FKBP51 or its pharmacological inhibition (SAFit2, 0.5 µM) normalized synaptic strength and GluN2B 
expression, establishing FKBP51’s critical role in maintaining iLTP. Notably, cDCS intervention replicated these protec­
