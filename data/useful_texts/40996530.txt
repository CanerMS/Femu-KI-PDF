Transspinal stimulation with direct current or at intensities and frequencies that produces intermittent depolarization of 
motoneurons can be an adjunct treatment strategy for spasticity and recovery of movement in persons with spinal cord 
injury (SCI). The main objective of this study was to assess changes in neurophysiological biomarkers after multiple ses­
sions of transspinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) in people with and without SCI. Nine SCI and 10 healthy control 
subjects received daily cathodal tsDCS over the Thoracic 10 vertebra while supine with an average stimulation intensity 
of 2.28 ± 0.02 mA. SCI and healthy control subjects received an average of 15 and 10 stimulation sessions, respectively. 
Before and 1–2 days post intervention, we assessed changes in soleus H-reflex recruitment input-output curves, homo­
synaptic depression and postactivation depression. tsDCS did not alter the strength of homosynaptic depression in any 
subject group but reversed postactivation depression to facilitation in AIS D subjects. tsDCS resulted in depression of 
reflex excitability in both subject groups. No significant changes in clinically assessed hyperreflexia were observed in
