Accurate and individualized human head models are becoming increasingly important 
for electromagnetic (EM) simulations. These simulations depend on precise anatomical 
representations to realistically model electric and magnetic field distributions, particularly when 
evaluating Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) within safety guidelines. State of the art simulations 
use the Virtual Population due to limited public resources and the impracticality of manually 
annotating patient data at scale. This paper introduces Personalized Head-based Automatic 
Simulation for EM properties (PHASE), an automated open-source toolbox that generates high*Corresponding author. yuankai.huo@vanderbilt.edu (Y. Huo).
