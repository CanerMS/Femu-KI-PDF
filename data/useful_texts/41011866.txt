A novel dual-band dual-mode wearable button antenna for wireless body area network
(WBAN) applications is proposed in this paper. The antenna ingeniously integrates a
monopole structure and an optimized planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) configuration in a
shared radiator, enabling dual-mode operation with a compact size. In the low-frequency
band, the monopole structure generates an omnidirectional radiation pattern, facilitating
efficient on-body communication. Meanwhile, the PIFA structure in the high-frequency
band exhibits directed radiation, optimizing off-body communication. To enhance bandwidth, a parasitic structure is incorporated into the design. Both numerical simulations
