This study described a rare case of a 46-­year-­old man presented with a 27-­year history of visual reduction in his right eye. He reported a 27-­year history of an electric shock that led to immediate unconsciousness. On admission, his best-­corrected visual acuity was hand motion in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Examination revealed anterior subcapsular patchy opacities with a 
central calcification-­like appearance in the right lens and patchy opacities in the left lens. Several irregular skin scars were visible 
on his head and left lower extremity. He was diagnosed with electric cataract and injury. He underwent cataract phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation in the right eye. Complete resolution of symptoms was achieved at a 1 week follow-­up.
