The widespread deployment of 5G wireless networks alongside existing GSM technologies has increased the need to assess
potential biological effects of co‐exposure to multiple radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF‐EMF). This study evaluates the
in‐vitro impact of simultaneous exposure to 5G‐modulated 3.5 GHz and GSM‐modulated 1.8 GHz signals on neuronal electrical
activity, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cellular stress protein responses in neurons and skin
fibroblasts. Primary cortical neurons and human immortalized skin fibroblasts were exposed to RF‐EMF at specific absorption
rates (SAR) of 1 or 4 W/kg for 15 min or 24 h, respectively. Neuronal activity was analyzed using multi‐electrode arrays (MEAs),
