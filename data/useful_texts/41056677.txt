the response of organisms to electromagnetic ra­ diation encompasses not only oxidative stress but also metabolic 
changes. Unfortunately, although there are more research on the bio­
logical effects caused by microwave bands above 6 GHz in the 5 G bands 
(Karipidis et al., 2021), the scientific basis of the 3.5 GHz band below 
6 GHz is only a few studies (Altman et al., 2016; Bektas et al., 2022; 
Joushomme et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022, 2021; Yang et al., 2022; 
Zubair et al., 2020). It reveals the potential impact of several stress 
response routes.
