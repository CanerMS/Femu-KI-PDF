Electromagnetic (EM) safety guidelines are designed to protect the general public and workers from the risks posed by exposure
to EM sources of all types, with the exception of medical EM sources. However, it has never been systematically evaluated
whether individuals with conductive implants are also protected by these guidelines or whether the local field enhancement due
to presence of the implant may pose an unacceptable risk under certain realistic exposure conditions. To address this important
knowledge and regulatory gap, we first evaluated the upper bound of the local enhancement of bare and insulated generic
implants of 0.5 λ (approximately equal to resonant) and 0.1 λ lengths, but restricted the maximum length to 2 m, as a function
