Following the global progressive deployment of 5G networks, considerable attention
has focused on assessing their potential impact on human health. This study aims
to investigate autonomous nervous system changes by exploring skin temperature
and electrodermal activity (EDA) among 44 healthy young individuals of both sexes
during and after exposure to 3.5 GHz antenna-emitted signals, with an electrical field
intensity ranging from 1 to 2 V/m. The study employed a randomized, cross-over design
with triple-blinding, encompassing both ‘real’ and ‘sham’ exposure sessions, separated
by a maximum interval of 1 week. Each session comprised baseline, exposure and
postexposure phases, resulting in the acquisition of seven runs. Each run initiated with
a 150 s segment of EDA recordings stimulated by 10 repeated beeps. Subsequently,
