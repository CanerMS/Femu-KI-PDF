we demonstrated that ME films can be used as direct neural interfaces without needing any additional electronics on board. By designing the geometry of ME films and input magnetic 
fields, we established that they can generate enough power to modulate activity of neurons wirelessly in nonresonant frequencies, which 
is proven through in vitro calcium imaging experiments. In addition, we presented evidence to enlighten the stimulation mechanism. We demonstrated that the stimulation is through involvement 
of sodium and calcium channels, which indicates the presence of 
electrical neuromodulation. Future work will be conducted to tackle 
translational challenges of ME films and explore potential long-­term 
use of them in vivo.
